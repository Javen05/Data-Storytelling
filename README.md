# Data-Storytelling

### Project Specifications:
You are to explore the call log and walk-in records dataset to derive insights and conduct an analysis for OCBC to find out customer satisfaction. Before you can visualise the data, there is a need to understand the business requirements, understand the data, and perform data exploration. 

You will apply data visualisation techniques and data storytelling techniques to effectively convey the insights derived from your data to the stakeholders.

### Part 1 – Data Visualisation

Task 1 : Background and Business Requirement
•	Provide a context for the background and business requirements.
•	Who is the client/stakeholders?
•	Why are they embarking on the analysis?
•	At an overview level, what would OCBC like to get out of this analysis?

Task 2 : Data Management
•	Perform Data Profiling
-	Examine the data attributes.
-	Examine the structure of the data tables and how they are related.
-	Perform data audit to identify any data quality issues. You need to do data auditing even if no data quality issues are discovered.
•	Perform Data Integration
-	Document the steps you took to bring the data tables together.
-	Explain the rationale for choosing the method of integration.
•	Perform Data Preparation
-	Note that there is no need to document data cleaning.
-	Instead, for data preparation, create at least ONE new field. Explain how this new field will add value to your analysis.

Task 3 : Data Exploration
•	Explain four (4) key takeaways based on your understanding of data. You will be assessed based on:
-	Correct usage of chart.
-	Demonstration of understanding of visualisation techniques.
-	Explanation of the purpose of each chart (consider composition, comparison, relationship, distribution).
-	Explanation of the relationships and analytical interaction.
-	How in-depth your analysis is and how sound your interpretation is.


### Part 2 – Data Storytelling

Task 1 : Visual Cues
•	Continuing from the data exploration you have done in Part 1 – Data Visualisation, show at least TWO enhancements to your visuals. Considering the good practices when using some of these visual cues: 
-	Use the right visuals
-	Colour and contrast
-	Visual hierarchy
-	De-clutter
-	Annotation

Task 2 : Dashboard
•	Create ONE dashboard by bringing some of your visuals together. 
•	These are some considerations for your dashboard:
-	The design, placement of visuals and visual cues used
-	Does it communicate clearly and effectively to users?
-	Are the insights useful to users?
-	How user-friendly is it?
-	Does it allow interactivity for the users?

Task 3 : Explore and Generate Insights 
(You do not need to document this in your report, document in Tableau)
•	Generate some insights from your visuals by turning some of the interpretations you have done earlier into sticky notes. 
-	Create one sticky note (annotation) for each visual. 
-	Create at least one sticky note for your dashboard. 

Task 4 : Big Idea, Linear Storyboard, Narrative Framework
•	Write down the big idea by considering the audience.
-	Who are they?
-	What might motivate them?
-	What would keep them up at night?
-	What action do you need them to take?
•	With the audience in mind, create a linear storyboard 
-	What is the problem, action/analysis and outcome?
-	Use the sticky notes you have created earlier to do this.
•	Next, think about the narrative framework (Freystag’s Pyramid) 
-	What tension exists for the audience?
-	What does your analysis suggest that will help resolve this tension?
-	What pieces of content will you need to provide your audience? 

Task 5 : Tableau Story
•	Create a Tableau Story to communicate the message behind the data to your audience.
•	Here are some considerations:
-	How well is the narrative framework incorporated into your digital story?
-	Do the visualisations used complement what you want to communicate?
-	Are the recommendations relevant to the problem statement?
-	Is there a hook? Does it generate a sense of urgency? Is there a call for action?

### IDL Group Project:
- Collaborate with students in Diploma in Pharmaceutical Science to integrate data visualization and storytelling skills to explain factors that led to failure of tablet batch.

### Files:
- Data.zip (raw data provided)
- Data Cleaning.yxmd (my workflow to clean data)
- Cleaned Data.zip (cleaned raw data using workflow)

- OCBC Presentation (Slides presentation for OCBC internship)

### Mistakes in assignment 1:
- Composition of Pie chart for Takeaway 1 is invalid as I mistakenly compute it by SUM instead of COUNT.

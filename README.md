## About projects:
This repo consists of 2 seperate projects for my school's Data Storytelling module. Both projects required me to create a Storyboard using Tableau to explain insights into the business using the Freystag's Pyramid storytelling method. 

### Part 1+2
> OCBC Customer Service has been declining recently, and I am engaged as a Data Analyst to uncover the underlying causes for poor customer service and explain these insights to the higher-ups using a Storyboard to convince them to act on the recommendations that I have derived from my analysis.

### ASC (Group Project)
> Kanban Pte Ltd wants to find out what causes Maxeo tablets to fail the British Pharmacopaeia Uniformity of Weight Test so that they can rectify any potential issues in their production to minimize loss of resources.
